# PhytoPilot Companion Application

PhytoPilot is an automatic IoT based hydroponics system. This repository contains the code for the PhytoPilot companion application which is used to communicate with the PhytoPilot unit.

The application was developed on the AWS Amplify development platform to enable easy integration with AWS backend services for a React Native based application. The application uses AWS Cognito to provide a complete authentication experience. AWS IoT is used to communicate with PhytoPilot using the MQTT protocol. 

A demonstration of the application can be seen below.
